    * Checks to see if the bounds of this Game Object overlaps with the bounds of the given Display Object,

    * 
    * This check ignores the `hitArea` property if set and runs a `getBounds` comparison on both objects to determine the result.
    * 
    * Therefore it's relatively expensive to use in large quantities, i.e. with lots of Sprites at a high frequency.
    * It should be fine for low-volume testing where physics isn't required.
